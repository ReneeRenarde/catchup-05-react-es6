# Catchup #5: React ES6
## Instructions
### Clone to your computer
* **note** The `$` below means "Type this in the Terminal". When writing the following Terminal commands, ignore the `$` and type the rest. You will see people represent the Terminal on sites like Stackoverflow with the `$`. Repeat. You don't need to type the `$`. (Don't confuse this `$` with the `$` from jQuery)

`$ git clone https://githttps://github.com/kingluddite/react-es6-catchup.git`

### Pull down all branches
* Each of the lessons will be contained inside their own branches. You need to pull down these remote branches to your local machine
* Use the following two commands to pull remote branches down to your local machine

* `$ git fetch --all`
* `$ git pull --all`

### Checkout branches locally
* To focus more on the code we will just checkout a branch to work on the next lesson
* You have access to the repo after the Catchup so you can play around with the code (the best way to learn how to code is.... to code)
* To checkout a branch just type any of the following to checkout that particular branch
* To see all your branches you can type `$ git branch`, (you won't see a list of the branches until you check each one out individually)
* To break out of the list of branches type `q` for quit

```
$ git checkout master
